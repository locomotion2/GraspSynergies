# Analyzing Kinematic-Muscular Synergies in Object Manipulation: The Impact of Task Knowledge on Anticipatory Information during Reach and Grasp Phases


## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with extracting combined kinematic- muscular synergies, see the description below and refer to the Method section of the Master´s Thesis.


## Description
In this Master´s thesis kinematic and muscular synergies in the human grasp are analyzed through a human motor control study. The participants have to perform a lift and hold task with different 3D printed handle under various weight conditions. The movements of the hand are recorded by three webcams and the kinematics are extracted through the media pipeline neural network using the free motion capture software freemocap. The myoelctric signals from forearm and thenar muscles are recorded via two OTB+ Grid electrodes (2x64) while the muscle activity of extensor muscles in the forearm as well as Biceps and Triceps are recorded by Myobock EMG sensors. 

## Usage
Download the jupiter notebook scripts and install VS Code to open it. The Scripts are written in Python. Install necessary libraries and packages through the python terminal. The numbering of the files serves as guidance how the recording, processing and analysis pipeline was conducted.
